# RAW
Currently in beta.

**Raw** is an open web tool developed at the [DensityDesign Research Lab](http://www.densitydesign.org) (Politecnico di Milano) to create custom vector-based visualizations on top of the amazing [d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) library.
Primarily conceived as a tool for designers and vis geeks, Raw aims at providing a missing link  between spreadsheet applications (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, OpenRefine) and vector graphics editors (e.g. Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, ...).

**Raw** works with delimiter-separated values (i.e. csv and tsv files) as well as with copied-and-pasted texts from other applications (e.g. Microsoft Excel, TextWrangler, TextEdit). Based on the [svg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg) format, visualizations can be easily imported in and edited with vector graphics applications for further refinements, or directly embedded into web pages.

Knowing the need of working with sensitive information, the data uploaded to **Raw** is processed only by the web browser: no server-side operation or storage are performed - no one will see, touch or copy your data!

**Raw** is also highly customizable and extensible, accepting new custom layouts defined by users. For more information about how to add or edit layouts, see the Documentation section.

##Usage
The easiest way to use Raw is by accessing the most updated version on the [official app website](http://app.raw.densitydesign.org). However, as an open source Node.js/Express app, Raw can also run locally on your machine. 

##Installation
If you want to run your instance of Raw locally on your machine, be sure you have [Node.js](http://dnodejs.org/) installed, otherwise [download](http://nodejs.org/download/) and install it.

###Requirements

- [git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) 
- [Bower](http://bower.io/#installing-bower)


Clone Raw from the command line:

	$ git clone git://github.com/densitydesign/raw.git

browse to Raw root folder:

	$ cd raw

install server-side dependencies:

	$ npm install
	
run server:

	$ npm start

Once this is running, go to [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).


##Documentation and Support

Documentation and FAQs about how to use Raw can be found on the [official website](http://raw.densitydesign.org). Development guide will be available soon on the Wiki of this repository. Sorry for this.
